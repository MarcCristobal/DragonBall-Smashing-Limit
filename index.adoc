== Idea

== History

The game's premise is that enemies attack Earth with the aim of destroying it, but they give it a chance to survive: by hosting a global martial arts tournament to test the strength of its inhabitants. If any Earthling emerges as the champion, the planet will be saved. However, if one of the enemies wins, Earth will be destroyed.

=== Special Mechanics

In the game, combos can only start with a light attack followed by a heavy attack. If you try to start a combo with a heavy attack, it won't work, and you'll have to wait for your character to recover before trying again. This adds strategy to the game, as players must plan their moves to execute combos effectively and avoid vulnerability to the opponent's attacks.

=== HUD

The HUD provides vital information during gameplay. Some elements that may appear on the screen include:

- Health Bar: Represents the player's remaining health.
- Time Counter: Indicates the remaining time in the battle.

=== Progression System

The game consists of three fights. The first is easy, the second is harder, and the third is the toughest. As you progress, enemies become stronger, with increased health and attack frequency in each subsequent fight. If you win all three fights, you win the game.

=== Frequently Asked Questions
